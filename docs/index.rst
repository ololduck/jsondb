Welcome to JSONdb's documentation!
==================================

Purpose
-------

JSONdb is a relational db. It is nor fast, nor adapted for large data. It is intended for when you need to store some data, but maybe edit it by hand after.

The main usage is simple: You instanciate a JSONdb object, and then use the methods add and get.

This module is fully documented with inner doc, so you can use it in a repl.
